Automatically retrieve payslip PDFs from [ADP Freedom](https://myfreedom.adp.com), which ironically despite the name only works in Internet Explorer by default.

See `./payslip.sh -h` for usage instructions.

Requires `gdate` aka GNU date on macOS. You can obtain this with `brew install coreutils` if running Homebrew.

Assumptions:
 - You're in the UK and paid only once a month.
 - You're paid on the 27th.

Patches welcome.
